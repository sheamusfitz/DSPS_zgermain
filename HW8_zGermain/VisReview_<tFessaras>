CLARITY: Points are clear, color is clear and cohesive. Fonts and sizes are good. Lines are little bit ambiguous without key (without relying on caption).

AESTHETIC: The colors of the points are fine and colorblind compliant. It seems a litle busy due to the nature of having many points
with small sizes but I can tell what is going on. The lines are the most confusing as they do not extend far.

HONESTY: Plot doesn't look like it has distortion. The data is represented as it is and has no more or less constraints.

Improvements:
1. Make the light color points (especially the cyan) have an outline, they are hard to see.

2. Extend the red, yellow, and orange lines further up and make them transparent. Also maybe put a label or legend for them.

3. Make points slightly more transparent so that the colors blend more easily and don't overlap

Quality: Overall I have few complaints above this plot, and the ones I do are minor. It is easy to read the text and numbers. 
The color selection is good for a continuous parameter (and colorblind compliant. The shape of the plot is able to be determined.
